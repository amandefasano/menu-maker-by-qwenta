# Menu Maker by Qwenta
Project n°9 of the OpenClassrooms software testing's diploma course

## Description
Qwenta is a fictional printing company. In this project, I was in charge of planning the development of their Menu Maker project, an online tool designed to customize and publish restaurant menus.\
My responsibilities included building a web technology watch system.
Then, I had to define the project's technical needs. Furthermore, thanks to the insights provided by the watch system, I had to find a technical solution for each of those needs.
Eventually, in an Agile approach, I wrote the user stories that will have to be developed, and planned their distribution across different sprints.
